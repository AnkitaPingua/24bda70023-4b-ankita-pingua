This project implements a RESTful API that allows users to manage a collection of playing cards. The API supports standard CRUD operations:

Create a new card

Read all cards

Read a specific card

Update a card (PUT / PATCH)

Delete a card

The API follows REST principles:

Stateless communication

Resource-based URLs

Uses standard HTTP methods

Returns appropriate HTTP status codes

JSON formatted responses
